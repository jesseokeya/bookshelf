# Login Form

## Background

Depending on the type of application you're building, you may or may not have to
write TONS of forms, but you certainly will have some. There are some great form
libraries out there if your app is in the TONS of forms camp (try
[Formik](https://formik.dev/)), but we don't need to bother with a form library
for the use cases of this app. React's built-in form support is all we need.

## Exercise

NOTE IF YOU ARE DOING THIS IN CODESANDBOX: When doing this exercise you'll be
working inside a `@reach/modal` which is a fantastic component and does great
things for accessibility. One of those things is prevent focus from happening
anywhere outside the component... including the codesandbox editor.

To get around this limitation either:

1. Close the modal before making code changes
2. Open the browser preview in another tab instead of using the one that shows
   up by default.

For this exercise we're going to start from basically the beginning. We need to
make a form that hits our API to register a new user and authenticate an
existing user.
